## Usage
1) First install the node dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
or if yarn it's not installed use:
```bash
npm install
```

2) Then run the grunt tasks to prepare the images:
```bash
grunt
```

3) Finally serve the `index.html` with:
```python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
The file can now be accessed at `http://localhost:8000`
